# Joomla Chit Chat Group

**Who, why, and... 42?**

The Joomla Chit Chat Group started shortly after the beginning of the *Cradle of the Web Civilization*, and has endured to this day. We moved on from the ancient technology of Skype, a staple of the stone age, onto greener pastures, not slacking around, just gitting our stuff done.

We are a trust based group, with shared ideals, and common interests. Our group is invitation-only, where long-standing members can invite people they know and trust either personally, or professionally (known for high work ethics). Ideally, the invited person must work with Joomla, and like the platform.

**Intents**

We have gathered as a group of trusted web professionals from varied backgrounds to network, foster collaboration and share information that can not only help others, but also maybe, perhaps, improve the state of Joomla.

On a daily basis, we ask and answer questions, exchange information, techniques, tips & tricks, and general chit-chattery about Joomla and web design, ux, ia, development, maintenance, and whatnot. We also talk about science, philosophy, politics, humanity, past, future, great stuff, annoying stuff, and all that...

It must be noted that this is not a group for people to advertise their services. We are all a mix (in different proportions) of developer, designer, integrator, and so on. If someone needs something, that person will ask in the group if there's anyone knowledgeable and available for that.

**Joomla Chit Chat Group Rules**

1. New members must be invited by existing members with Admin privileges or higher.
2. New members will have a 12 months or more waiting period to become Admins, and another 12 months or more to become owners. That period can be extended by owners, at their criteria.
3. Joining our GitHub organization is highly encouraged, and contributions will help not only people in our group, but the public in general, since the repositories are all public.
4. The current primary owner must maintain the list of members here in our GitHub, with their join date, current status, and ideally skills and portfolio link.
5. The primary Slack owner should be rotated to a different owner every 6 to 12 months. This is a volunteer based position, and the person must have the availability to maintain the team, check invites, and maintain a good environment for the members. When there are no other eers, the current owner can volunteer to continue in the role until another owner volunteers.
6. In case of issues, disputes, and general lack of good behavior, current owners can take actions to remediate the situation. Input from at least three owners is expected before a decision is made.
7. This set of rules must be kept as simple as possible, following the spirit of trust and ethics on which this group is based.

Welcome, and enjoy!
